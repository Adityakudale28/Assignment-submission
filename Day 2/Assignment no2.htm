            "Everything is possible under the sun if we just put our cares away and really start living. A lot of time will be saved by conscientiously doing things that make us productive in every way."
            Written in 2014 by Leandro Pasamba --- Philippines
            Be like a farmer who sweats it out at the crack of the dawn. Expecting a bountiful harvest for all his efforts, he heartily laughs in sheer contentment.
            "There's no need to be perfect to inspire others. Let people get inspired by how you deal with your imperfections."
